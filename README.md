The backend is built as a REST API via the Go web application.  

It also acts as the webserver to serve the front end react application

All api actions are accessible with the /api route.  The frontend is accessible from /.

### Requirements
+ Go 1.6
+ NodeJS 4.2.6

#### Building the Go backend
Go Application which manages the Factorio server.

API requests for managing the Factorio server are sent to /api.

The frontend code is served by a HTTP file server running on /.
```
git clone https://github.com/MajorMJR/factorio-server-manager.git
cd factorio-server-manager
go build
```

#### Building the React frontend
Frontend is built using React and the AdminLTE CSS framework. See app/dist/ for AdminLTE included files and license.

The root of the UI application is served at app/index.html.  Run the npm build script and the Go application during development to get live rebuilding of the UI code.

All necessary CSS and Javascript files are included for running the UI.

Transpiled bundle.js application is output to app/bundle.js, 'npm run build' script starts webpack to build the React application for development
```
 install nodejs (use nvm)
 cd ui/
 npm install
 npm run build
 Start factorio-server-manager binary in another terminal
```
